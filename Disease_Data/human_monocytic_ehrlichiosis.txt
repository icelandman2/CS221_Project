This bacterium is an obligate intracellular pathogen affecting monocytes and macrophages.\n\n\n== Symptoms ==\nThe most common symptoms are fever, headache, malaise, and muscle aches (myalgia). Compared to human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, rash is more common. Laboratory abnormalities include thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver tests.\nThe severity of the illness can range from minor or asymptomatic to life-threatening. CNS involvement may occur. A serious septic or toxic shock-like picture can also develop, especially in patients with impaired immunity.\n\n\n== Cause ==\nThis Disease is known to be caused by Tick Bites\n\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nTick exposure is often overlooked. For patients living in high-prevalence areas who spend time outdoors, a high degree of clinical suspicion should be employed.\nEhrlichia serologies can be negative in the acute period. PCR is therefore the laboratory diagnostic tool of choice.\n\n\n== Treatment ==\nIf ehrlichiosis is suspected, treatment should not be delayed while waiting for a definitive laboratory confirmation, as prompt doxycycline therapy has been associated with improved outcomes. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice.\nPresentation during early pregnancy can complicate treatment.Rifampin has been used in pregnancy and in patients allergic to doxycycline.\n\n\n== Epidemiology ==\nIn the USA, HME occurs across the south-central, southeastern, and mid-Atlantic states, regions where both the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and lone star ticks (Amblyomma americanum) thrive.\nHME occurs in California in Ixodes pacificus ticks and in Dermacentor variabilis ticks.Nearly 600 cases were reported to the CDC in 2006. In 2001\u20132002, the incidence was highest in Missouri, Tennessee, and Oklahoma, as well as in people older than 60.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHuman ewingii ehrlichiosis\nHuman granulocytic anaplasmosis\nMonocyte\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links =="}}}, "limits": {"extracts": 20}}
