It is typically a red or brown irritated patch of skin with clear rings. The infection causes itching or a burning sensation in the area which is affected. Most likely originating from the groin, thigh skin folds or anus, it is possible for the infection and rash to spread to any parts of the body and is highly contagious. It may involve the inner thighs and genital areas, as well as extending back to the perineum and perianal areas.\nAffected areas may appear red, tan, or brown, with flaking, rippling, peeling or cracking skin.\nThe acute infection begins with an area in the groin fold about a half-inch across, usually on both sides. The area may enlarge, and other sores may develop. The rash has sharply defined borders that may blister and ooze.\nTinea cruris has similar symptoms to inverse psoriasis.\n\n\n== Causes ==\n\nOpportunistic infections (infections that are caused by a diminished immune system) are frequent. Fungus from an athlete's foot infection can spread to the groin through clothing. Tight, restrictive clothing, such as jockstraps, traps heat and moisture, providing an ideal environment for the fungus.\nThe type of fungus involved is usually Trichophyton rubrum. Some other contributing fungi are Candida albicans, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Epidermophyton floccosum.\n\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nTinea cruris is similar to, but different from candidal intertrigo, which is an infection of the skin by Candida albicans. The latter is more specifically located between intertriginous folds of adjacent skin, which can be present in the groin or scrotum, and be indistinguishable from fungal infections caused by tinea. However, candidal infections tend to both appear, and with treatment, disappear more quickly.\n\n\n== Prevention ==\nMedical professionals recommend a preventative based approach of stopping fungus before it occurs. Prevention is preferable over a reactive treatment approach. The preventative based approach involves removing heat and moisture from the groin area.\nDry off with a clean towel immediately after showering, swimming or perspiring.\nShower after physical activities.\nWear underwear with high air and moisture permeability fabric, such as linen (flax).\nIf dealing with athlete's foot, put socks on first before wearing underwear to avoid spreading the fungus.\nAvoid using other people's cloths and towels.\n\n\n== Treatment ==\nTinea cruris is best treated with topical antifungal medications of the allylamine or azole type. The evidence is best for terbinafine and naftifine but other agents may also work.\nThe benefits of the use of topical steroids in addition to an antifungal is unclear. There might be a greater cure rate but no guidelines currently recommend its addition. The effect of Whitfield's ointment is also unclear.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\neMedicineHealth.com\nMayoClinic.com, jock itch.\nJock Itch / Tinea Cruris Pictures (Hardin MD Super Site Samples)\nGenekeyes.com, how to Prevent Jock Itch with Rubbing Alcohol.\nspecheal.com, Tinea cruris \u2013 Symptoms, causes, prevention and treatment."}}}, "limits": {"extracts": 20}}
