It is due to infection by bacterium of the genus Nocardia, most commonly Nocardia asteroides or Nocardia brasiliensis.\nIt is most common in men, especially those with a weakened immune system. In patients with brain infection, mortality exceeds 80%; in other forms, mortality is 50%, even with appropriate therapy.\nIt is one of several conditions that have been called the great imitator. Cutaneous nocardiosis commonly occurs in immunocompetent hosts.\n\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\nPulmonary infection\nProduces a virulent form of pneumonia (progressive)\nNight sweats, fever, cough, chest pain\nPulmonary nocardiosis is subacute in onset and refractory to standard antibiotherapy\nSymptoms are more severe in immunocompromised individuals\nRadiologic studies show multiple pulmonary infiltrates with tendency to central necrosis\nNeurological infection\nHeadache, lethargy, confusion, seizures, sudden onset of neurological deficit\nCT scan shows cerebral abscess\nNocardial meningitis is difficult to diagnose\nCardiac conditions\nNocardia has been highly linked to endocarditis as a main manifestation\nIn recorded cases, it has caused damage to heart valves whether natural or prosthetic\nLymphocutaneous disease\nNocardial cellulitis is akin to erysipelas but is less acute\nNodular lymphangeitis mimics sporotrichosis with multiple nodules alongside a lymphatic pathway\nChronic subcutaneous infection is a rare complication and osteitis may ensue\nMay be misidentified and treated for as a staph infection, specifically superficial skin infections\nCultures must sit more than 48 hours to guarantee an accurate test\nOcular disease\nVery rarely nocardiae cause keratitis\nGenerally there is a history of ocular trauma\nDisseminated nocardiosis\nDissemination occurs through the spreading enzymes possessed by the bacteria\nDisseminated infection can occur in very immunocompromised patients\nIt generally involves both lungs and brain\nFever, moderate or very high can be seen\nMultiple cavitating pulmonary infiltrates develop\nCerebral abscesses arise later\nCutaneous lesions are very rarely seen\nIf untreated, the prognosis is poor for this form of disease\n\n\n== Causes ==\nNormally found in soil, these organisms cause occasional sporadic disease in humans and animals throughout the world. Another well publicized find is that of Nocardia as an oral microflora. Nocardia spp. have been reported in the normal gingiva and periodontal pockets along with other species such as Actinomyces, Arthromyces and Streptomyces spp.\nThe usual mode of transmission is inhalation of organisms suspended in dust. Another very common method is that by traumatic introduction, especially in the jaw. This leads to the entrance of Nocardia into the blood stream and the propagation of its pathogenic effects. Transmission by direct inoculation through puncture wounds or abrasions is less common. Generally, nocardial infection requires some degree of immune suppression.\nA weakened immune system is a general indicator of someone who is more susceptible to nocardiosis, such as someone who already has a disease that weakens their immune system. Additionally, those with low T-cell counts or other complications involving T-cells can expect to have a higher chance of becoming infected. Besides those with weak immune systems, a local traumatic inoculation can cause nocardiosis, specifically the cutaneous, lymphocutaneous, and subcutaneous forms of the disease.\n\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nDiagnosis of nocardiosis can be done by a doctor using various techniques. These techniques include, but are not limited to: a chest x-rays of the lung, a bronchoscopy, a brain/lung/skin biopsy, or a sputum culture.\nHowever, diagnosis may be difficult. Nocardiae are gram positive weakly acid-fast branching rod-shaped bacteria and can be visualized by a modified Ziehl\u2013Neelsen stain like Fite-Faraco method. In the clinical laboratory, routine cultures may be held for insufficient time to grow nocardiae, and referral to a reference laboratory may be needed for species identification. Infiltration and pleural effusion are usually seen via x-ray.\n\n\n== Treatment ==\nNocardiosis requires at least 6 months of treatment, preferably with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or high doses of sulfonamides. In patients who do not respond to sulfonamide treatment, other drugs, such as ampicillin, erythromycin, or minocycline, may be added.\nTreatment also includes surgical drainage of abscesses and excision of necrotic tissue. The acute phase requires complete bed rest; as the patient improves, activity can increase.\nA new combination drug therapy (sulfonamide, ceftriaxone, and amikacin) has also shown promise.\n\n\n== Prognosis ==\nThe prognosis of nocardiosis is highly variable. The state of the host's health, site, duration, and severity of the infection all play parts in determining the prognosis. As of now, skin and soft tissue infections have a 100% cure rate, and pleuropulmonary infections have a 90% cure rate with appropriate therapy. The cure rate falls to 63% with those infected with dissemented nocardiosis, with only half of those surviving infections that cause brain abscess. Additionally, 44% of people who are infected in the spinal cord/brain die, increasing to 85% if that person has an already weakened immune system. Unfortunately, there is not a preventative to nocardiosis. The only recommendation is to protect open wounds to limit access.\n\n\n== History ==\nAlthough there is not international data available on worldwide infection rates per year, there are roughly 500\u20131000 documented cases of nocardiosis a year. Most of these cases occur in men, as there is a 3:1 ratio of male of female cases a year; however, this difference may be based on exposure frequency rather than susceptibility differences. From an age perspective, it is not highly more prevalent in one age group than another. Cutaneous Nocardiosis is slightly more common in middle aged men, but as a whole, all ages are susceptible. Additionally, there is no racial basis when it comes to becoming infected with Nocardiosis.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links =="}}}, "limits": {"extracts": 20}}
