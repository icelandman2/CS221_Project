Involvement of the trigeminal nerve can cause numbness of the face.\n\n\n== Pathophysiology ==\nRamsay Hunt syndrome type 2 refers to shingles of the geniculate ganglion. After initial infection, varicella zoster virus lies dormant in nerve cells in the body, where it is kept in check by the immune system. Given the opportunity, for example during an illness that suppresses the immune system, the virus travels to the end of the nerve cell, where it causes the symptoms described above.\nThe affected ganglion is responsible for the movements of facial muscles, the touch sensation of a part of ear and ear canal, the taste function of the frontal two-thirds of the tongue, and the moisturization of the eyes and the mouth. The syndrome specifically refers to the combination of this entity with weakness of the muscles activated by the facial nerve. In isolation, the latter is called Bell's Palsy.\nHowever, as with shingles, the lack of lesions does not definitely exclude the existence of a herpes infection. Even before the eruption of vesicles, varicella zoster virus can be detected from the skin of the ear.\n\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n\n\n== Treatment ==\nTreatment with the steroid prednisone and the antiviral drug acyclovir 800mg 5 times a day is controversial, with some studies showing to achieve complete recovery in patients if started within the first three days of facial paralysis, with chances of recovery decreasing as treatment was delayed. Delay of treatment may result in permanent facial nerve paralysis. However, some studies demonstrate that even when steroids are started promptly, only 22% of all patient achieve full recovery of facial paralysis.\nTreatment apparently has no effect on the recovery of hearing loss. Diazepam is sometimes used to treat the vertigo.\n\n\n== Prevention ==\n\nShingles is prevented by immunizing against the causal virus, varicella zoster, for example through Zostavax, a stronger version of chickenpox vaccine.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe syndrome is named for James Ramsay Hunt, the eminent neurologist who first described it.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNINDS Herpes Zoster Oticus Information Page National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\nRamsay-Hunt Syndrome.
