It is also known as Kaposi varicelliform eruption, Pustulosis varioliformis acute and Kaposi-Juliusberg dermatitis.\nSome sources reserve the term \"eczema herpeticum\" when the cause is due to human herpes simplex virus, and the term \"Kaposi varicelliform eruption\" to describe the general presentation without specifying the virus.\nThis condition is most commonly caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 or 2, but may also be caused by coxsackievirus A16, or vaccinia virus. It appears as numerous umbilicated vesicles superimposed on healing atopic dermatitis. it is often accompanied by fever and lymphadenopathy. Eczema herpeticum can be life-threatening in babies.\n\n\n== History ==\nEczema herpeticum was first described by Austrian dermatologist Moriz Kaposi in 1887. Fritz Juliusberg coined the term Pustulosis varioliformis acute in 1898. Eczema herpeticum is caused by Herpes simplex virus HV1, the virus that causes cold sores; it can also be caused by other related viruses.\n\n\n== Presentation ==\nThis infection affects multiple organs, including the eyes, brain, lung, and liver, and can be fatal.\n\n\n== Treatment ==\nIt can be treated with systemic antiviral drugs, such as aciclovir or valganciclovir. Foscarnet may also be used for immunocompromised host with Herpes simplex and acyclovir-resistant Herpes simplex.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHerpes simplex\nList of cutaneous conditions\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEczema Herpeticum photo library at Dermnet\nImages of Eczema herpeticum from Pedoia"}}}, "limits": {"extracts": 20}}
