Mustelids (minks, ferrets, and foxes), skunk, and raccoons serve as natural hosts. There are currently only two species in this genus including the type species Carnivore amdoparvovirus 1 (Aleutian mink disease virus). Diseases associated with this genus include: progressive disorder of immune system.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nGroup: ssDNA\n\n\n== Structure ==\nViruses in Amdoparvovirus are non-enveloped, with icosahedral and Round geometries, and T=1 symmetry. The diameter is around 18-26 nm. Genomes are linear, around 4.8kb in length. \n\n\n== Life cycle ==\nViral replication is nuclear. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment to host receptors, which mediates clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Replication follows the rolling-hairpin model. DNA templated transcription, with some alternative splicing mechanism is the method of transcription. The virus may exit the host cell by vesicular trafficking following nuclear pore export or be released following cell lysis. Mustelids, skunk, and raccoons serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are oral and respiratory.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nViralZone: Amdovirus\nICTV\nAleutian Mink Disease at the US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)\nAleutian Mink Disease Virus at the US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)"}}}, "limits": {"extracts": 20}}
