It is characterized by fever and vesicles with subsequent ulcers in the mouth and on the snout, feet, and teats. The pathogen is relatively resistant to heat, and can persist for a long time in salted, dried, and smoked meat products. Swine vesicular disease does not cause economically-important disease, but is important due to its similarity to foot-and-mouth disease.\n\n\n== Transmission ==\nSwine vesicular disease is most commonly brought into a herd by the introduction of a subclinically infected pig. The disease can be transmitted in feed containing infected meat scraps, or by direct contact with infected feces (such as in an improperly cleaned truck).\n\n\n== Clinical signs ==\nAfter an incubation period of up to seven days, the signs associated with swine vesicular disease occur. The first sign is a transient mild fever. Other signs include:\nVesicles in the mouth and on the snout and feet\nLameness and an unsteady gait, shivering and jerking\u2013type leg movements\nRuptured vesicles can cause ulcers on limbs and feet, and foot pads may be loosened.\nYoung animals are more severely affected. Recovery often occurs within a week. There is no mortality.\nSwine vesicular disease has the same clinical signs as foot-and-mouth disease, and can only be diagnosed by laboratory testing.\n\n\n== Prevention and control ==\nThere is no vaccine for SVD. Prevention measures are similar to those for foot-and-mouth disease: controlling animals imported from infected areas, and sanitary disposal of garbage from international aircraft and ships, and thorough cooking of garbage. Infected animals should be placed in strict quarantine. Eradication measures for the disease include quarantining infected areas, depopulation and disposal of infected and contact pigs, and cleaning and disinfecting contaminated premises.\n\n\n== History ==\nSwine vesicular disease was first identified in Italy in 1966. In 1971, an outbreak occurred in Hong Kong, and the disease was subsequently found other countries in Europe and Asia.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links =="}}}, "limits": {"extracts": 20}}
