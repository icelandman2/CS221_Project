It is a small, Gram-negative bacillus with bipolar staining by Wayson stain. In animals, it can originate fulminant septicaemia (chicken cholera), but is also a common commensal.\nUntil taxonomic revision in 1999, Mannheimia spp. were classified as Pasteurella spp., and infections by organisms now called Mannheimia spp., as well as by organisms now called Pasteurella spp., were designated as pasteurellosis. The term \"pasteurellosis\" is often still applied to mannheimiosis, although such usage has declined.\n\n\n== Types ==\nThe several forms of the infection are:\nSkin/subcutaneous tissue disease is a septic phlegmon that develops classically in the hand and forearm after a cat bite. Inflammatory signs are very rapid to develop; in 1 or 2 hours, edema, severe pain, and serosanguineous exudate appear. Fever, moderate or very high, can be seen, along with vomiting, headache, and diarrhea. Lymphangitis is common. Complications are possible, in the form of septic arthritis, osteitis, or evolution to chronicity.\nSepsis is very rare, but can be as fulminant as septicaemic plague, with high fever, rigors, and vomiting, followed by shock and coagulopathy.\nPneumonia disease is also rare and appears in patients with some chronic pulmonary pathology. It usually presents as bilateral consolidating pneumonia, sometimes very severe.\nZoonosis, pasteurellosis can be transmitted to humans through cats.\nOther locations are possible, such as septic arthritis, meningitis, and acute endocarditis, but are very rare.\n\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nDiagnosis is made with isolation of Pasteurella multocida in a normally sterile site (blood, pus, or cerebrospinal fluid).\n\n\n== Treatment ==\nAs the infection is usually transmitted into humans through animal bites, antibiotics usually treat the infection, but medical attention should be sought if the wound is severely swelling. Pasteurellosis is usually treated with high-dose penicillin if severe. Either tetracycline or chloramphenicol provides an alternative in beta-lactam-intolerant patients. However, it is most important to treat the wound.\n\n\n== Animals ==\nP. multocida causes numerous pathological conditions in domestic animals. It often acts with other infectious agents, such as Chlamydia and Mycoplasma species and viruses. Environmental conditions (transportation, housing deficiency, and bad weather) also play a role.\nThese diseases are considered caused by P. multocida, alone or associated with other pathogens:\nShipping fever in cattle and sheep (\"shipping fever\" may also be caused by Mannheimia haemolytica, in the absence of P. multocida, and M. haemolytica serovar A1 is known as the most common cause of the disease. The pathologic condition commonly arises where the causative organism becomes established by secondary infection, following a primary bacterial or viral infection, which may occur after stress, e.g. from handling or transport.)\nEnzootic pneumonia of sheep (and goats, with frequent intervention of M. haemolytica)\nFowl cholera (chicken and other domestic poultry and cage birds)\nEnzootic pneumonia and atrophic rhinitis of pigs\nPasteurellosis of chinchillas\nPasteurellosis of rabbits\nPasteurellosis is suspected to be the cause of recurrent mass mortality of Saiga antelopes.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHemorrhagic septicemia\nPasteurellaceae\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPasteurella multocida-related diseases in sheep and goats"}}}, "limits": {"extracts": 20}}
