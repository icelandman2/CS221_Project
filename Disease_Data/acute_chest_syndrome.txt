This condition commonly manifests with a new opacification of the lung(s) on a chest x-ray.\n\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\nThe crisis is a common complication in sickle-cell patients and can be associated with one or more symptoms including fever, cough, excruciating pain, sputum production, shortness of breath, or low oxygen levels.\n\n\n== Cause ==\nAcute chest syndrome is often precipitated by a lung infection, and the resulting inflammation and loss of oxygen saturation leads to further sickling of red cells, thus exacerbating pulmonary and systemic hypoxemia, sickling, and vaso-occlusion.\n\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nThe diagnosis of acute chest syndrome is made difficult by its similarity in presentation with pneumonia. Both may present with a new opacification of the lung on chest x-ray. The presence of fevers, low oxygen levels in the blood, increased respiratory rate, chest pain, and cough are also common in acute chest syndrome. Diagnostic workup includes chest x-ray, complete cell count, reticulocyte count, ECG, and blood and sputum cultures. Patients may also require additional blood tests or imaging (e.g. a CT scan) to exclude a heart attack or other pulmonary pathology.\n\n\n== Prevention ==\nHydroxyurea is a medication that can help to prevent acute chest syndrome. It may cause a low white blood cell count, which can predispose the person to some types of infection.\n\n\n== Treatment ==\nBroad spectrum antibiotics to cover common infections such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and mycoplasma, pain control, and blood transfusion. Acute chest syndrome is an indication for exchange transfusion.\nBronchodilators may be useful but have not been well studied.\n\n\n== Prognosis ==\nIt may result in death, and it is one of the most common causes of death for people with sickle cell anemia.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links =="}}}, "limits": {"extracts": 20}}
