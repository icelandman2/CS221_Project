Natural infection is currently restricted to humans and the virus is transmitted by direct contact, droplet spread, or contaminated objects.\\nIt is considered a vaccine-preventable disease, although significant outbreaks have occurred in recent years in developed countries such as America, in areas of poor vaccine uptake. These have allowed the further evaluation and ennumeration of its efficacy (~75\\u201385% after two doses of MMR).\\nMumps virus belongs to the genus Rubulavirus in the family Paramyxoviridae and produces roughly spherical, enveloped virions of about 200 nm in diameter. The mumps virus genome is a linear, single-stranded molecule of negative-sense RNA and 15,384 nucleotides in length.\\n\\n\\n== Basic morphology ==\\n\\nElectron microscopy (EM) revealed that the mumps virus (MuV), like other members of the Paramyxoviridae, has an enveloped virion of roughly spherical or pleiomorphic (variable) shape. Paramyxovirus particles can have sizes ranging from 120\\u2013450 nm in diameter.\\nThese particles consist of what is known as a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex: a single-stranded, linear RNA genome coated by nucleocapsid proteins (NP) in association with an RNA polymerase complex of both large (L) and phosphoprotein (P) subunits. It has been estimated that over 2,000 such NP molecules coat the genome along with about 250 P and 25 L molecules.\\nThis RNP structure interacts with the viral envelope via matrix (M) proteins that are evenly distributed around the virion. The envelope, a lipid bilayer derived from the host-cell plasma membrane, harbours multiple copies of a number of glycoproteins required for virus entry and exit: hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), fusion (F), and the small hydrophobic (SH) protein.\\nThis molecular assembly of protein, RNA, and lipids allows a single virus to bind to and infect specific cells and replicate itself and finally exit the cell to be transmitted to the next susceptible host.\\n\\n\\n== Genotypes ==\\nAlthough there is only one serotype of the mumps virus, according to recent update by WHO (June 2012), there are currently 12 genotypes A-N, (namely A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, N) excluding (E and M). L-Zagreb vaccine strain comes under genotype N. The typing scheme is based on the sequence of the small hydrophobic (SH) gene.\\nThere are several subgenotypes (D1, D2 G1, G2, H1, H2) which are designated by numerals after the letter. G2 is the current subgenotype circulating in the Indian subcontinent.\\nAmong vaccine strains, Jerryl Lynn and Rubini belong to genotype A, Urabe is genotype B. It is not clear yet if there is any clinical significance to the genotypes.\\n\\n\\n== Pathogenesis ==\\nThe mumps virus can infect ependymal cells in the central nervous system.\\n\\n\\n== Vaccination ==\\nSeveral strains are used to vaccinate against mumps. These include the strains Jerryl Lynn, L-Zagreb, Leningrad-3 and Rubini and Urabe.\\nUniversal mumps vaccination was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1988.\\n\\n\\n== References =="}}},"limits":{"extracts":20}}'
