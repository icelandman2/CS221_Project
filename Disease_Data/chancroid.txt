Chancroid is known to spread from one individual to another solely through sexual contact. While uncommon in the western world, it is the most common cause of genital ulceration worldwide.\n\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\n\nThese are only local and no systemic manifestations are present. The ulcer characteristically:\nRanges in size dramatically from 3 to 50 mm (1/8 inch to two inches) across\nIs painful\nHas sharply defined, undermined borders\nHas irregular or ragged borders\nHas a base that is covered with a gray or yellowish-gray material\nHas a base that bleeds easily if traumatized or scraped\npainful swollen lymph nodes occurs in 30 to 60% of patients.\ndysuria (pain with urination) and dyspareunia (pain with intercourse) in females\nAbout half of infected men have only a single ulcer. Women frequently have four or more ulcers, with fewer symptoms.\nThe initial ulcer may be mistaken as a \"hard\" chancre, the typical sore of primary syphilis, as opposed to the \"soft chancre\" of chancroid.\nApproximately one-third of the infected individuals will develop enlargements of the inguinal lymph nodes, the nodes located in the fold between the leg and the lower abdomen.\nHalf of those who develop swelling of the inguinal lymph nodes will progress to a point where the nodes rupture through the skin, producing draining abscesses. The swollen lymph nodes and abscesses are often referred to as buboes.\n\n\n=== Males ===\nInternal and external surface of prepuce.\nCoronal sulcus\nFrenulum\nShaft of penis\nPrepucial orifice\nUrethral meatus\nGlans penis\nPerineum area\n\n\n=== Females ===\nLabia majora is most common site. \"Kissing ulcers\" may develop. These are ulcers that occur on opposing surfaces of the labia.\nLabia minora\nFourchette\nVestibule\nClitoris\nPerineal area\nInner thighs\n\n\n== Causes ==\nChancroid is a bacterial infection caused by the fastidious Gram-negative streptobacillus Haemophilus ducreyi. It is a disease found primarily in developing countries, most prevalent in low socioeconomic groups, associated with commercial sex workers. In the United States socioeconomic status has not been found to be a factor in the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.\nChancroid, caused by H. ducreyi has infrequently been associated with cases of Genital Ulcer Disease in the US, but has been isolated in up to 10% of genital ulcers diagnosed from STD clinics in Memphis and Chicago.\nInfection levels are very low in the Western world, typically around one case per two million of the population (Canada, France, Australia, UK and US). Most individuals diagnosed with chancroid have visited countries or areas where the disease is known to occur frequently, although outbreaks have been observed in association with crack cocaine use and prostitution.\nChancroid is a risk factor for contracting HIV, due to their ecological association or shared risk of exposure, and biologically facilitated transmission of one infection by the other. Approximately 10% of people with chacroid will have a co-infection with syphilis and/or HIV.\n\n\n== Pathogenesis ==\nH. ducreyi enters skin through microabrasions incurred during sexual intercourse. A local tissue reaction leads to development of erythomatous papule, which progresses to pustule in 4\u20137 days. It then undergoes central necrosis to ulcerate.\n\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n\n\n=== Variants ===\nSome of clinical variants are as follows.\n\n\n=== Laboratory findings ===\nFrom bubo pus or ulcer secretions, H. ducreyi can be identified. PCR-based identification of organisms is available. Simple, rapid, sensitive and inexpensive antigen detection methods for H. ducreyi identification are also popular. Serologic detection of H. ducreyi is and uses outer membrane protein and lipooligosaccharide.\n\n\n=== Differential diagnosis ===\n\nDespite many distinguishing features, the clinical spectrums of following diseases may overlap with chancroid:\nPrimary syphilis\nGenital herpes\nPractical clinical approach for this STI as Genital Ulcer Disease is to rule out top differential diagnosis of Syphilis and Herpes and consider empirical treatment for Chancroid as testing is not commonly done for the latter.\n\n\n=== Comparison with syphilis ===\nThere are many differences and similarities between the conditions syphilitic chancre and chancroid.\nSimilarities\nBoth originate as pustules at the site of inoculation, and progress to ulcerated lesions\nBoth lesions are typically 1\u20132 cm in diameter\nBoth lesions are caused by sexually transmissible organisms\nBoth lesions typically appear on the genitals of infected individuals\nBoth lesions can be present at multiple sites and with multiple lesions\nDifferences\nChancre is a lesion typical of infection with the bacterium that causes syphilis, Treponema pallidum\nChancroid is a lesion typical of infection with the bacterium Haemophilus ducreyi\nChancres are typically painless, whereas chancroid are typically painful\nChancres are typically non-exudative, whereas chancroid typically have a grey or yellow purulent exudate\nChancres have a hard (indurated) edge, whereas chancroid have a soft edge\nChancres heal spontaneously within three to six weeks, even in the absence of treatment\nChancres can occur in the pharynx as well as on the genitals\n\n\n== Prevention ==\nChancroid spreads in populations with high sexual activity, such as prostitutes. Use of condom, prophylaxis by azithromycin, syndromic management of genital ulcers, treating patients with reactive syphilis serology are some of the strategies successfully tried in Thailand.\n\n\n== Treatment ==\nThe CDC recommendation for chancroid is a single oral dose (1 gram) of azithromycin, or a single IM dose of ceftriaxone, or oral erythromycin for seven days.\nAbscesses are drained.\nH. ducreyi is resistant to sulfonamides, tetracyclines, penicillins, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, trimethoprim and aminoglycosides. Recently, several erythromycin resistant isolates have been reported.\nTreatment failure is possible with HIV co-infection and extended therapy is sometimes required.\n\n\n== Complications ==\nExtensive adenitis may develop.\nLarge inguinal abscesses may develop and rupture to form draining sinus or giant ulcer.\nSuperinfection by Fusarium and Bacteroides. These later require debridement and may result in disfiguring scars.\nPhimosis can develop in long standing lesion by scarring and thickening of foreskin, which may subsequently require circumcision.\n\n\n== Prognosis ==\nPrognosis is excellent with proper treatment. Treating sexual contacts of affected individual helps break cycle of infection.\n\n\n== History ==\nChancroid has been known to humans since time of ancient Greeks. Some of important events on historical timeline of chancre are:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVaccine Shown Effective Against Chancroid in Medical News Today (May 9, 2006).
