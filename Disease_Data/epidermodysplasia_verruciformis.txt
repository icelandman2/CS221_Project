It is characterized by abnormal susceptibility to human papillomaviruses (HPVs) of the skin. The resulting uncontrolled HPV infections result in the growth of scaly macules and papules, particularly on the hands and feet. It is typically associated with HPV types 5 and 8, which are found in about 80% of the normal population as asymptomatic infections, although other types may also contribute.\nThe condition usually has an onset of between the ages of one and 20 but can occasionally present in middle age. The condition is also known as Lewandowsky\u2013Lutz dysplasia \u2013 named after the physicians who first documented it, Felix Lewandowsky and Wilhelm Lutz.\n\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\nClinical diagnostic features are lifelong eruptions of pityriasis versicolor-like macules, flat wart-like papules, one to many cutaneous horn-like lesions, and development of cutaneous carcinomas.\nPatients present with flat, slightly scaly, red-brown macules on the face, neck, and body, recurring especially around the penial area, or verruca-like papillomatous lesions, seborrheic keratosis-like lesions, and pinkish-red plane papules on the hands, upper and lower extremities, and face. The initial form of EV presents with only flat, wart-like lesions over the body, whereas the malignant form shows a higher rate of polymorphic skin lesions and development of multiple cutaneous tumors.\nGenerally, cutaneous lesions are spread over the body, but some cases have only a few lesions which are limited to one extremity.\n\n\n== Genetics ==\nThe cause of the condition is an inactivating PH mutation in either the EVER1 or EVER2 genes, which are located adjacent to one another on chromosome 17. These genes play a role in regulating the distribution of zinc in the cell nuclei. Zinc is a necessary cofactor for many viral proteins, and the activity of EVER1/EVER2 complex appears to restrict the access of viral proteins to cellular zinc stores, limiting their growth.\nOther genes have also rarely been associated with this condition. These include the ras homolog gene family member H.\n\n\n== Treatment ==\nNo curative treatment against EV has been found yet. Several treatments have been suggested, and acitretin 0.5\u20131 mg/day for 6 months\u2019 duration is the most effective treatment owing to antiproliferative and differentiation-inducing effects.\nInterferons can also be used effectively together with retinoids.\nCimetidine was reported to be effective because of its depressing mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation and regulatory T cell activity features. A report by Oliveira et al. showed that cimetidine was ineffective. Hayashi et al. applied topical calcipotriol to a patient with a successful result.\nAs mentioned, various treatment methods are offered against EV; however, most importantly, education of the patient, early diagnosis, and excision of the tumoral lesions take preference to prevent the development of cutaneous tumors.\n\n\n== Notable cases ==\n\n\n=== Ion Toader ===\nIn March 2007, a Romanian man named Ion Toader was diagnosed with this condition. A patient of dermatologist Carmen Madeleine Curea, his pictures appeared on numerous blogs and Romanian press sources. Curea works with Spitalul Clinic Colentina in Bucharest, Romania. Stephen Stone, past president of the American Academy of Dermatology, confirms this is Lewandowsky\u2013Lutz. Toader underwent surgery in late 2013, and since then has been mostly symptom-free, with only small reappearances.\n\n\n=== Dede Koswara ===\nIn November 2007, a video of a 34-year-old Indonesian man named Dede Koswara with a similar disease appeared on the Internet. His story appeared on the U.S. Discovery Channel and TLC series My Shocking Story (Extraordinary People on UK's Five) in the episode \"Half Man Half Tree\". On August 12, 2008, Dede Koswara's story was the subject of an ABC's Medical Mystery episode entitled \"Tree Man\".\nOn 26 August 2008, Dede returned home following surgery to remove 6 kg (13 lb) of warts from his body. The surgery consisted of three steps:\nRemoval of the thick carpet of warts and massive horns on his hands\nRemoval of the smaller warts on his head, torso, and feet\nCovering of the hands with grafted skin\nIn all, 96% of the warts were removed. The surgery was documented by the Discovery Channel and TLC in the episode \"Treeman: Search for the Cure\". However, his warts returned and he was thought to require two surgeries per year for the rest of his life in order to manage the warts. The Discovery Channel funded a blood analysis and found he lacked an immune system antigen to fight yeast infection. He was offered to have more tests run to determine whether it is treatable, and the doctor was fairly optimistic, but he refused the treatment.\nAccording to the Jakarta Post, Dede underwent the first of a series of new surgical procedures to remove the regrown warts in the spring of 2011. Surgery had, however, proven to be a temporary solution for Dede, as the warts continued to re-emerge. He had thus undergone three surgical operations since his major surgery in 2008. At the end of December 2010, two doctors from the Japanese Society for Complementary and Alternative Medicine brought him a drug made from Job's tears. The medicine was still undergoing lab tests as of 2016.\nAged 42, Dede Koswara died on 30 January 2016, around 03:30 Western Indonesia Time, at Hasan Sadikin Hospital, Bandung, from the complications related to his condition.\nIn 2009, the Discovery Channel episode \"Treeman Meets Treeman\" reported on another Indonesian man, from the same region as Dede, who also has the disease and was given a similar treatment for it. His treatment seemed to have worked better.\n\n\n=== Omar Tamim ===\nIn 2013, one case of Epidermodysplasia verruciformis was reported in Iraq. No treatment was given since the condition was initially misdiagnosed.\n\n\n=== Abul Bajandar ===\nIn January 2016, a 25-year-old patient named Abul Bajandar from Khulna, Bangladesh was admitted in Dhaka Medical College and Hospital and was diagnosed with this condition. Doctors at the hospital decided to form a medical board for the treatment of the patient . Over the following year, Bajandar underwent at least 16 surgeries for the removal of the warts \u2013 weighing in excess of 5 kilograms (11 lb) \u2013 from his hands, feet, and legs.\n\n\n=== Sahana Khatun ===\nIn January 2017 it was reported that a 10-year-old girl in Bangladesh was diagnosed after developing lesions four months earlier. BBC News said that the case may have been the first diagnosis in a female.\n\n\n=== Mohammed Taluli ===\nIn August 2017 it was reported that a 42-year-old man from Gaza had been successfully operated on, by Israeli doctors, at the Hadassah Medical Centre in Jerusalem.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nYabe Y, Sadakane H (September 1975). \"The virus of epidermodysplasia verruciformis: electron microscopic and fluorescent antibody studies\".
