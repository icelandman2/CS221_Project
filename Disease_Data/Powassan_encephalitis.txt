It can occur as a co-infection with Lyme disease since both are transmitted to humans by the same species of tick. There has been a surge in the number of cases and geographic range in the last decade. In the United States, cases have been recorded in the northeast. The disease was first isolated from the brain of a boy who died of encephalitis in Powassan, Ontario, in 1958. The disease is a zoonosis, an animal disease, usually found in rodents and ticks, with spillover transmission to humans. The virus is antigenically related to the Far Eastern tick-borne encephalitis viruses.\n\n\n== Presentation ==\nSymptoms manifest within 7\u201310 days and include fever, headache, partial paralysis, confusion, nausea and even coma.\n\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n\n\n== Prognosis ==\nThere is currently no established treatment.\nHalf of all cases results in permanent neurological damage and 10-15% result in death.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links =="}}}, "limits": {"extracts": 20}}
