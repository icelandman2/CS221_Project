The incubation period is three weeks. Nephropathia epidemica has a sudden onset with fever, abdominal pain, headache, back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. More severe symptoms include internal hemorrhaging. Although fatal in a small percentage of cases, nephropathia epidemica is generally milder than the HFRS that is caused by hantaviruses in other parts of the world. The bank vole is the reservoir for the virus, which humans contract through inhalation of aerosolised vole droppings.\nThe majority of infected individuals are asymptomatic or develop only mild symptoms, and the disease is not known to spread from human to human.\nThis infection is known as sorkfeber in Swedish and myyr\u00e4kuume in Finnish (vole fever). In Norway, it is called musepest (mouse plague).\n\n\n== See also ==\nLeptospirosis\n\n\n== Sources ==\nRose A, Vapalahti O, Lyytik\u00e4inen O, Nuorti P.
