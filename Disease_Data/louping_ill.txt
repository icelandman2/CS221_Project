Louping-ill is a tick-transmitted disease whose occurrence is closely related to the distribution of the primary vector, the sheep tick Ixodes ricinus. It also causes disease in red grouse, and can affect humans. The name 'louping-ill' is derived from an old Scottish word describing the effect of the disease in sheep whereby they 'loup' or spring into the air.\n\n\n== Cause ==\nLouping ill is caused by RNA virus called Louping ill virus. Louping ill virus belongs to genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae.\nThere are four subtypes: British, Irish, Spanish and Turkish.\n\n\n== Prevention ==\nAccording to a ProMED article, disease in sheep has been controlled in the UK by a vaccine (ATCvet code: QI04AA01), originally developed by Scotland's Moredun Research Institute by Prof John Russell Greig. In 2009, however, a shortage of vaccine combined with an increase in the number of ticks found in sheep pasture areas cause an increased risk of this disease.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCommittee on Foreign Animal Diseases of the United States Animal Health Association (1998), Foreign Animal Diseases, Pat Campbell & Assoc/Carter Printing Co., ISBN 0-08-615213-0, archived from the original on 2009-02-13 \nLouping ill (pdf), Center for Food Security and Public Health, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University, 2005-08-05 \n\n\n== External links ==\nMoredun Research Institute vaccine article\nWHO vaccine listing: QI04AA01 (WHO))"}}}, "limits": {"extracts": 20}}
