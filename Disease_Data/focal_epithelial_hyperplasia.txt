Can present with slightly pale, smooth or roughened surface morphology. It is caused by the human papilloma virus types 13 and 32. It exhibits surface cells with vacuolated cytoplasm around irregular, pyknotic nuclei and occasional cells with mitosis-like changes within otherwise mature and well-differentiated epithelium. A distinguishing histologic feature is elongated rete ridges resembling Bronze Age axe with mitosoid bodies present. It was first identified in the Aboriginal population.\nOver time, they will spontaneously regress without treatment. Possible treatment may be excisional biopsy for lesions of functional or aesthetic concern.\n\n\n== References =="}}}, "limits": {"extracts": 20}}
