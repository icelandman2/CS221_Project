It can also be associated with other types of infections, such as human papilloma virus. An association with chromosome 2 has been identified.\n\n\n== Symptoms and signs ==\nThe symptoms of this condition are hyperkeratosis, skin ulcer, dyspareunia, endocardium abnormality, vision problems, hepatitis, seizures, hematuria and meningitis\n\n\n== Cause ==\nIn terms of the cause of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis one finds it can be inherited either autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive There are 9 types of this condition with the first CANDF1 being located at 2p22.3-p21(cytogenetically)\n\n\n== Mechanism ==\nThe mechanism of the human immune system has it normally fighting in an infection(like Candida). Initially Th17 cells are made by the immune system, which in turn produces interleukin-17 (IL-17).Inflammation is induced and white blood cells confront infection\nChronic mucocutaneous candidiasis mutations affect IL-17 by inhibiting its pathway. This in turn affects the human immune systems ability to fight infection, in total there are 9 possible types of this condition\n\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nChronic mucocutaneous candidiasis can be diagnosed in an affected individual via the following methods/tests:\n\n\n=== Types ===\n\n\n== Treatment ==\n\nManagement for an individual with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis consists of the following(relapse occurs once treatment is ceased, in many cases):\n\nSystemic antifungal therapy(e.g. Fluconazole)\nTransfer factor\nCombination therapy\nScreening(annually)\n\n\n== See also ==\nCandidiasis\nList of cutaneous conditions\n\n\n== Notes ==\n^ Indicates 9 references to specific, numbered pages in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKauffman, Carol A.; Pappas, Peter G.; Sobel, Jack D.; Dismukes, William E.
